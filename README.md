# Customer Churn Prediction 🚀

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes customer churn using machine learning models to predict which customers are at risk of leaving. By leveraging classification models such as **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost**, the goal is to improve customer retention strategies and optimize business decisions.  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset contains customer transaction and engagement data, including:  
- Customer demographics  
- Subscription details  
- Transaction history  
- Service usage patterns  
- Churn labels (1 = Churned, 0 = Retained)  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- **Model Evaluation**: AUC-ROC, Precision-Recall  

## 🔍 Approach  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Feature scaling  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Churn rate analysis  
   - Correlation heatmaps  
   - Customer behavior visualization  
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Trained **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost**  
   - Used **AUC-ROC and Precision-Recall** to compare models  
4. **Predictions & Insights**  
   - Identified key churn drivers  
   - Suggested strategies for customer retention  

## 🚀 Future Improvements  
- Implement **Hyperparameter Tuning** to improve accuracy  
- Add **Feature Engineering** for better insights  
- Deploy as a **Streamlit Web App** for real-time predictions  
- Integrate with **Tableau** for interactive dashboards
